/* buffers
   --->Temporary storagespot for a chunk of data that is being transferred from one place to another.
   --->The buffer is filled with data, then passed along.
   --->Transfer small chuncks of data at a time.

advantage:
        we can start consuming the data even before it fully arrives.

   Streams in Node.js
   --->can create streams in Node.js to transfer data
   --->Increase performance

/*
Streams
---> Writable streams: allow node.js to write data to a stream
---> Readable stream: allow node.js to read data from a stream
---> Duplex: can read and write to a stream
